# Multilayer-Artificial-neurak-network-from-scratch-in-Python

this particular implementation involves solving LOGIC GATES problem.
I took reference of many websites as well as few books and youtube videos.
I trained the network such that when user enters a pair of binary numbers then the model predicts whatever the output should be.
For example,if we choose XOR as our base problem.
then the program asks for two inputs in binary form.It fits the model and trains it by using Back-propagation.
the result obatained is not a perfect binary but a intermediate team close to the corresponding output.

inpu1=>1
input2=>0
desired output=>1
predicted_output=>0.98(which is close to 1)

similarly,
input1=>1
input2=>1
desired output=>0
predicted_output=>0.0034(which is close to 0)

The way it worked on XOR ,similarly it works on AND,OR and XNOR.
